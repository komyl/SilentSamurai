## SilentSamurai

SilentSamurai is a sophisticated time management and synchronization tool that leverages multiple sources of time signals, machine learning models, and satellite data to maintain highly precise timekeeping and anomaly detection. It uses an amalgamation of time-based data from different global sources to ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliability. The system is designed to be robust, resilient, and optimized for environments where time synchronization is critical.

## Features

- Time Synchronization with Earth-based Atomic Clocks: Synchronize with atomic clocks using NTP servers.

- Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning: Detect anomalies in the synchronization process using IsolationForest and RandomForestClassifier.

- Time-Based Key Generation: Generate unique cryptographic keys based on oscillator frequency and temperature drift.

- Energy and Power Management: Manage power reserves and optimize energy usage.

- Real-Time Alerts: Send alerts for critical anomalies detected during synchronization.

- Monte Carlo Simulation for Drift Analysis: Analyze drift errors using Monte Carlo simulations for more robust predictions.

- Historical Drift Data Analysis: Store drift data in a SQLite database and generate historical reports.

- Visualization of Time Drifts: Visualize simulation results using histograms, line plots, and boxplots.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later

- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pytz, ntplib, pandas, scikit-learn, sqlite3, smtplib, pika, cachetools, gps3

- RabbitMQ server for distributed simulations

- SMTP email setup for sending real-time alerts

## Explanation

SilentSamurai is a time synchronization and anomaly detection system that operates in environments where precision is paramount. It uses multiple NTP servers to sync time, generates keys based on environmental factors, and employs machine learning models to detect anomalies in the timing data. It also visualizes the results of Monte Carlo simulations, which analyze potential drift errors.

## Inspiration
This project, SilentSamurai, is inspired by the intricacies and precision of time measurement technologies and devices such as:
- Citizen Caliber 0100: This watch boasts an incredible accuracy of +/- 1 second per year, which inspires the precision we aim for in this project.
- Atomic Watches in Satellites: The accuracy of atomic clocks in satellites, such as those used in GPS systems, is essential for precise time synchronization, a feature critical to SilentSamurai.
- Time-Coding Stations on Earth: These stations are vital in coordinating and synchronizing time globally, which inspired the synchronization mechanisms implemented here.
- Doomsday Watch: A concept that inspired our exploration of resilience and accuracy in extreme conditions.
- Spring Drive: Known for its unique blend of mechanical and electronic timekeeping, which influenced our approach to merging traditional concepts with modern technology.
- Vacheron Constantin Ref 57260: This is a complex watch with 57 complications, highlighting the importance of attention to detail and precision, a core aspect of SilentSamurai.
- Perpetual Calendars: These inspired the time-based algorithms ensuring accurate tracking without manual intervention.
- Tourbillon: This mechanism counters gravitational effects to improve accuracy, reflecting our drive for optimizing precision under variable conditions.

## Important Notes

- Ensure RabbitMQ is running if you plan to use the distributed simulation features.
- SMTP email credentials must be configured properly for alerting to function.
- The project assumes a reliable internet connection for NTP synchronization and email alerts.
- GPS functionality requires a GPS receiver connected to the system.
